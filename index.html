					<p>Client wanted an iOS app for their electric skateboard. The bulk of design work was done in about 2 weeks.</p>
					<p>Requirements included being able to turn on and off the lights, see the battery meter and other metrics, and set various settings. There was also an eye to safety.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="work-content-2">
					<p>
					<strong>Process</strong><br>I worked with an awesome iOS developer who helped with feedback, gathering requirements, and we iterated on designs together.</p>
					<p>Some of the changes over time: The lights needed bigger, easier controls that were easier to toggle &mdash; particularly in the case of interacting with the app while on a skateboard. I minimized the trips, and reworked the visual design with feedback. A few changes I did to make things slightly technologically easier: make trips distinct without having to redraw on expansion, and added controls to start and end trips so we didn't create erroneous trips.</p>

				<p>This is some of my work as a full-time product designer at Riparian Data (later called Skimbox).</p>
				<p>One of my findings was around making email more action-based. This prototype was designed to surface important information and an interface to make these decisions. My work ranged from exploratory research, interaction design, prototyping, and validation with usability testing.</p>
			</div>
				<div class="work-content-2">
					<p><strong>Process</strong><br>My process varied with the particular constraints, but I integrated user research where I could, and iterated with other stakeholders (engineering, marketing, and potential partners) while keeping in mind business goals. When I was a bit new, I did interviews and contextual inquiries (and a few observations when I could) to inform who I was designing for. I synthesized this to personas, scenarios, and requirements; these would get revisited with later validation. Then I created wireframes and flows for the email app, or low-fidelity prototypes. These would graduate to higher-fidelity prototypes. I tested with people every few weeks to feed changes into the next sprint.</p>

				<p>Fun side project with two friends to learn how to make an iOS application for our friends.</p>
				<p>We wanted to incentivize various behaviors: linking to social networks, voting more, and sharing their opinions on social networks. The leaderboard, feedback on how your votes compared with your friends after every 5 votes, and achievements were all designed for these behaviors.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="work-content-2">
				<p>
				<strong>Process</strong><br>Since we were making something for ourselves, I didn't do a lot of user research. I talked to a few people in our target audience for a quick sanity check before proceeding. I played with a few different ways to incentivize voting and sharing their votes. I took it around to a few people in our target demographic, and learned that the visual heirarchy got messed up with the introduction of the top leaderboard bar as well as centering our incentivization around informed voting. I changed the top bar and introduced a way to compare your votes with other firms' portfolios.</p>
