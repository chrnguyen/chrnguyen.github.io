I was thinking about the Asiana flight today. We fixate on this one pilot, who does bear a lot of responsibility (lots of lives, in fact). However, we are so quick to jump over the analysis of the cockpit culture that also lends itself to people not speaking out. 

Then I thought about startup culture. I do think because of the types of personalities that are attracted to engineering, design, and entrepreneurship, we do get a lot of outspoken people and dissenting opinions. And I think this conflict is great-- given that there's some way to decide at a nonglacial pace and that people act quickly on decisions.
