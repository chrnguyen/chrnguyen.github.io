There's definitely a lot of discussion on how a cofounder partnership is similar to romantic partnership. Here are some practices that my significant other ([@itsthomson][1]) and I have adopted from the startup world.

To help us be somewhat accountable on various professional, spending, social, and health goals, we do our own version of planning/retro/scrum. It's hard to make sure we're making progress in some areas each week, so we set aside time to set in our minds what that we want to get done for the next week. Obviously we don't go into details of the work, but if you're concerned about it, a variation may be to raise-happiness at work to a higher level or maintain. During this time, we also sort of set expectations on how much time we'll have for each other, and to reallocate some time when one of us is going to be out of town for a little while. We lightheartedly make fun of each other if we're not meeting goals and try to do some reflection on why not and how to progress. We ping each other as we feel like it, as couples do, to continue to try to understand and learn from each other.

In a relationship, we're not creating code-- we're undertaking adventures. And the data on how we've grown together feeds back. 
We keep a backlog of adventures to undertake on a rainy day (or more likely, a sunny day) on a Google Doc.
Transparency: We do share our Mint budgets, our Withings scale data (still working out our fitness tracking), Asana personal task lists, and Google calendars. We don't share passwords or any sort of account.
Retrospectives on our relationship also aren't very structured, and the particular way that we work is to try to talk through things when things are happening. It's not something that I do naturally-- I like taking a bit of time to take some time away and reflect-- but that tendency does sometimes grow into burying and running away from problems. So we've been going back and forth on it, trying to iterate on how we handle conflict resolution.
We do share a confidence in numbers, and love taking out spreadsheets for heavier decision making (weighing the criteria/requirements and then grading how each solution does against them)-- but that's probably more of an artifact of how we work.
Though the description above sounds like we have rigid rules, our relationship doesn't really have as much structure-- we don't exactly plan out what we're going to be trying out together too far in advance (we say we're taking things five days at a time, for now anyways).

Hope this structure increases focus on embarking on new adventures with your statistically significant other, figuring out what works for the both of you.
