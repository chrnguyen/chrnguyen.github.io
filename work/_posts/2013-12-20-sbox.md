## Riparian Data
I worked for Riparian Data as a Product Designer-- focusing on our iOS app and merging UX research, lean and agile processes, so that we could constantly learn from people. Riparian originally focused on creating responsive web apps. Riparian rebranded as Skimbox in 2013.

## Learnings
### Platform
Especially for email, people will find an email application rather than go to an email address. On desktop, for a lot of businesses still, they are embedded in Microsoft Office.

We worked on a responsive web app at first, which was easier to quickly prototype with-- but definitely was not a product that people would use because of their behavior.

We then moved to iOS from my research. The company also probably needed to work on desktop email applications.
### Email behaviors
Triaging is one of the behaviors that most apps and people focus on-- with good reason, since a lot of users check their email on their phone. Most users may not necessarily reply (though they do reply), but they want to feel on top of what's come into their inbox. 

I came up with 4 personas based on a number of user interviews: Roger, who tries to cyclically clear out his inbox (not quite to zero); Paul, who feels out of the control and just lets things pile up; Carol, who files everything away in Outlook; Elsa, a social butterfly that inbox zeroes.
### Trust in algorithms
Filing things away for users is difficult, because the act of filing creates a memory to reference where that email went. When we were working on a web app, most people didn't realize there were other minimized sections of emails and questioned where a few of their emails went. We created a panel to the right so that they could see all of their less important emails' headers at a glance. This worked alright, but that doesn't quite hold true in mobile where screen real estate is precious. Even for some people getting 150+ emails/day, the potential for losing important emails was too high if we didn't come across as super trustworthy.

![sbox5](/images/portfolio/sbox5.png) When we were working on the idea of marking something as "to read," or something that needs a response, that created some confusion for a few users. Even though it's consistent with their mental model of how they process email, the trust for a computer to do so was pretty limited.
### Pulling structure and providing context
I think one of the more interesting areas of email can be by providing context and structure to emails. By showing an action that could be relevant to the user, we don't purport to know exactly what you want to do, but bring to the forefront a potential action that you may want to take. It also provides some information what the email may be about without having to go into the email-- this can be useful for the skimmable section. 
## Process
The design process was constrained by working remotely, 1 to 2-week agile development sprints, and little or nonexistent data on users. I worked with the development and QA team fairly closely, along with the rest of the small company (the CEO and marketing) to embed user-centeredness throughout the company. I worked a bit more with our graphic designer at the beginning, but on the iOS app, I became responsible for the look and feel as well as interactive elements and usability.

Exploration usually included in-person user interviews and contextual inquiries. Observation was fairly limited due to the sensitive nature of email, but I tried to fold that in as much as I could. These folded into personas, which got revised when we focused our target users and behaviors to help.

To communicate flows and rough layouts, I provided sketchy wireframes usually through Balsamiq or sometimes other tools I wanted to try out. Since we were trying to just validate ideas, we would work together to create prototypes to try different ideas and then iterate over the usability problems. The fast nature of this kept me to low-medium fidelities mostly and helping out with front-end prototypes. Working closely with developers, we would pull together a works-like prototype to test with people, which didn't include any visual polish except for contrasting shades of grey.

When we got to a point where people were not frustrated with the product, we added in more of the styles and colors.

I would set up user tests for our learning objectives and any new pieces of functionality that were coming down in a week or two. Depending on what we were trying to find out, I would pull some people from our database of potential testers. Anyone on the team could drop in as observers to the remote moderated testing and had access to videos (subject to the tester's consent). They submitted additional questions on Campfire during the remote moderated testing, which got folded in as necessary.

I would generally define the pieces of the design to be changed a bit upstream (depending on how big), work with development to improve upon the designs, set up and moderate user tests, and then synthesize findings to recommend what to do next cycle. This cycle of design/test/refinement ranged from a week and a half to a few weeks, depending on the scope. QA also adopted personas into their testing environment. This not only included walkthroughs with each persona, but adopting them in test accounts and mimicking the personas' behaviors in those accounts.
