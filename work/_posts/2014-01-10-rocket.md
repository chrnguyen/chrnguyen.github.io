## Goal
We wanted to make an iOS app together to learn Objective C and make something for other startup-y people.

## Process (so far)
### Research
Since we were making something for ourselves, I didn't do a lot of user research since the idea came from some experience-- hearing so many people weighing in on investments in the press-- though I also talked to a few people in our target audience for a quick sanity check before proceeding.
### Sketching and Refinement
We sketched a few ideas together, and then I took some of the ideas to refine to a flow and information architecture. Since we already had a shared understanding of what the app should do, I wanted to create something more high-fidelity to quickly test with people.

### Gamification Aspects
![achivements](/images/portfolio/rocket4.png) Along with the leaderboard, I played around with different ways to incentivize various behaviors-- linking to social networks, voting more, and sharing their opinions on social networks. This is still a work in progress, and to the right is the first stab of what the first version of incentives could look like.
### Tradeoffs
A few features that we thought about were private voting, making it easier to skip companies, and providing feedback on your vote. 

![skipcompany](/images/portfolio/rocket5.png) Private voting disincentivizes sharing, but we wanted to also balance our emphasis on voting a lot with accuracy. I struggled with this a bit-- especially as accuracy changes over time, which makes status rewards difficult. Allowing for private voting (though locked until you did a few things) was one way to help with this.

We debated having three options instead of the two major buttons. If you scroll through the information of the company, you see a skip button at the bottom that you can use. Although it would be great if you could flick through companies, we wanted to have people think about the company at hand. Most people make snap-ish decisions based on headlines anyway. We wanted to emulate that same experience to see whether these snap judgements were less accurate.

After you vote, it brings you to the next company-- which has less friction, but doesn't provide a good moment for validation. We decided to show an aggregate once you pass a person or get an achivement for now, but is certainly up to what the data says.

### What's Next
We still haven't collected data on the decisions that we made in the tradeoffs section, which are certainly up to a mix of testing and whether we want to incentivize other things instead, as the product evolves.

I did find through some usability testing that no one knew what the top horizontal timeline was, and perhaps a button would be better if we actually wanted to provide some indicator of how many more votes they needed. In addition, the information hierarchy due to the bar wasn't super clear to a few people.

We probably still have to change some things to balance making voting addictive as well as getting feedback and focus on accuracy.
